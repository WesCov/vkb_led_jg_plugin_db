The VKB Gladiator NXT flight stick has three LEDs: a blue/red in the base,
a red near the hat switch, and a RGB (red, green, blue) LED at the top of
the handle.  These LEDs have programable levels of brightness and speeds of
blinking.  This Joystick Gremlin plugin allows these LEDs to be activated with
buttons on the stick or any other device configured in Joystick Gremlin (JG).
